How to compile:
    cd aes
    make

Usage (also available by calling `AES -h`):
    To use this utility, use the following flags:
    -b Key size in bits: 128, 192, 256
        Alternate:
            -bits NUM
            --buts=NUM
    -k Key file location
        Alternate:
            -key key File
            --key=KEY (value in hex, no separators, a la "01020304")

    Select a mode of operation:
    -e Encrypt File
        Alternate:
            -encrypt
    -d Decrypt File
        Alternate:
            -decrypt
    -c Combined Encrypt and Decrypt File
        Alternate:
            -combined

    -o Output file name (Flag optional, will default to stdout. Will be ignored if -c flag set, in which case program will write out to 'foo'.encrypted and 'foo'.decrypted)
        Alternate:
            -output FILENAME

    Input file handling:
    If no input file is selected, the program will default to stdin
    Otherwise choose one of the following:
        -i FILE
        -input FILE
        --input=KEY (value in hex, no separators, a la "01020304")
